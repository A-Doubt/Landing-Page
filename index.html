						<p>Border Collies are very energetic and smart dogs that require a lot of attention. It is a working and a herding dog breed.</p>
						<p>German Shepherds are the finest all-purpose working dogs. Their high agility and strength is on par with their intelligence.</p>
						<p>Golden Retrievers are considered to be one of the prime choices for a family dog. They desire everlasting company of a human and almost completely lack any form of agression.</p>
						<p>Huskies are thickly furred dogs belonging to the Spitz genetic Family. They are often described as 'escape artists', as they tend to find countless ways to break free and run away. After a few hours or even days they eventually happily come back to their owners.</p>

				<p>Ever consider what our dogs must think of us? I mean, here we come back from a grocery store with the most amazing haul, chicken, pork, half a cow. They must think we're the greatest hunters on earth.</p>
